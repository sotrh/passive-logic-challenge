# Simple Fluid System

## Running

You'll need to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you haven't already.
After you've done that you can call `cargo run` to start the demo.

## Controls

WASD for movement and left-click and drag to rotate the camera. Also
press `space` to move up and `shift` to move down.
